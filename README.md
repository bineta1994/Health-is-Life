# **Studio One**

The website is for a fitness company. The website will let the users know its purpose and the services offered.
## **UX**

The website is laid out in a way that allows users to navigate with ease. It also provides the kind of information they would expect. The home page has a brief paragraph that gives the user an idea of what the company does. Laid out the information in an organized manner and used complimenting color schemes, which enhances their user experience.

### **user stories**:
As a user type, when visiting a website I look at the homepage to give me a brief introduction of what the website is about, in this case the jumbotron and the header at the top lets me know the website is about a fitness company. I love how the website includes the social media links, allowing me to visit those pages and get up to date information about the company.

As a user type, I want to jump from one section to a specific section, the navigation bar and other links help me with that.

As a user type, i found the color combination appealing. I especially like how the footer has a nice greenish color, which highlights the information inside it.
