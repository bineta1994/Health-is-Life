						have taken catering to your needs to a whole new level when it comes to meal preparation. From specific foods of each
						meal, how it is seasoned, the type of meat and vegetable quality, down to how many exact meals required per week. Unlike
						other companies that demand a minimum order of meals per week or month, here at Studio One Fitness we do it on a weekly
						basis with no commitment to a minimum order of meals. We literally cater to you and your lifestyle, whether you only
						need breakfasts because your in too much of a rush to prepare it each day, or down to only one day a week because that
						day is full of meetings each week and you can never get your meals in. We consult on a weekly basis with our clients
						to discuss the clients needs for the upcoming week, and not only can you order food for specific fitness goals, but
						you can just because you have no time to prepare. As simple as that, you can contact us today for more details!</p>
